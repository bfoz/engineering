Engineering for Ruby
====================

This is a meta-gem for all things related to engineering. The Engineering module
is your one stop shop for all of the tools you need for your latest mad-engineering project.

Activating a dormant volcano? Adding death rays to your secret moon base? Plotting world domination? No problem! There's a gem for that, and you've found it right here.

If your latest and greatest project, and even your older ones, need something
that isn't in Engineering, either let me know, or fork and add it yourself (and
send me a pull request). Or feel free to create your own gem that reopens
the module and adds whatever is missing, if that's more your style.
